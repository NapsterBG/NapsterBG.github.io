                        Mercedes the history makers?
                        Mercedes still have a long way to travel before they match Ferrari's record of six consecutive Constructors' titles, set between 1999 and 2004, but the Silver Arrrows are already a long way down the road.

                        Another championship triumph in 2018 would be Mercedes' fifth in succession, eclipsing the four-title run Red Bull enjoyed at the turn of the decade.

                        But that fifth title may prove the hardest of all. Red Bull finished 2017 hot on their heels while Ferrari will be hell-bent on finishing the year as champions. As the clock ticks round to the tenth anniversary of their last F1 title triumph, the 2008 Constructors' Championship, the demand for success this year within Maranello will be at its most intense. Ferrari and Mercedes have become close friends off the track. On it, however, their rivalry in 2018 may never have been so fierce.


                        Sebastian v Lewis for fifth or Verstappen the First?
                        In 2017, Lewis Hamilton v Sebastian Vettel was the story of the season. In 2018, their anticipated rematch will go forth with extra resonance - the Australian GP on March 25 will make F1 history as the first season-opener to feature a pair of four-time world champions.

                        But tempting though it is to bill 2018 as another likely slugfest between Lewis and Sebastian, there are no guarantees it will turn out that way. If he starts where he left off in November, Abu Dhabi victor Valtteri Bottas is certainly a possible contender. So too are Red Bull pair Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo. What F1 would give for either of them to join the title party.

                        Rematch or not, F1's 2018 game of thrones has epic potential.


                        New voices and new start times
                        The times are indeed changing as F1's ongoing mini-revolution continues.

                        Races will commence at 10 minutes past the hour while the hour itself will also change for all the European events - as well as the Brazilian GP - with the start time pushed back by a further 60 minutes. Goodbye 1pm in mid-summer, hello 2.10pm.

                        The French GP, meanwhile, will be made to wait for its return just a little bit longer. After a 10-year absence, France's comeback has been delayed by another two hours in order not to clash with England v Panama in football's World Cup.

                        F1 really is moving with the times.

                        Fireworks in the paddock
                        For F1's new owners, Liberty Media, that infamous sporting phenomenon 'the difficult second season' may be fast approaching. As McLaren boss Zak Brown put it in January, "the honeymoon period is over" and 2018 is likely to see "public fireworks" as contracts are renewed, budgets are scrutinised and the rules are recast.

                        It could be quite a spectacle. Ferrari have already set off an ear-jarring firework by repeating quit threat after quit threat unless Liberty Media rethink their plans for 2021 and beyond.

                        Many in the paddock believe Ferrari are bluffing. And they probably are. But can Liberty risk the unthinkable?
